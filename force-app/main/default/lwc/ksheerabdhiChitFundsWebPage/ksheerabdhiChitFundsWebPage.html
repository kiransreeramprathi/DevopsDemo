		<h2>Who is Foreman?</h2>
		<p>The whole chit fund operations are overlooked by one member of the fund known as the Foreman. Foreman acts on behalf of the chit fund management company by collecting the monthly investment from each chit fund member to record member details and overlooking the auctioning process. In other words, the company is the foreman.</p>

                <h2>What is an Auction?</h2>
		<p>A chit fund starts at a pre-specified date. Members keep their monthly installments in the pot. After that, an open auction takes place, permitting subscribers to bid for the value. A member who is ready to get the lowest amount is a winner. He/she receives the chit fund in that month. The foreman always claims the first month's bid. The members auction from the months after.</p>
